/* Pseudocode and create a flowchart for a bubble sort algorith.
Provide a brief explanation and a simple array of integers to 
demonstrate a dry run of your algorith*/

*****Pseudocode**********

procedure bubbleSort(A:list of sortable items)
n:=length(A)
repeat
swapped:=false
for i:=1 to n-1 inclusive do 
if A[i-1]>A[i] then
swap(A[i-1],A[i])
swapped:=true
end if
end for 
n:=n-1
until not swappedend procedure


*****Brief explanation of how the algorith work*****

* It iterates through the array repeatedly, comparing adjacent 
  elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

* The algorithms continues iterating until no more swaps are needed
  indicating that the array is sorted.
